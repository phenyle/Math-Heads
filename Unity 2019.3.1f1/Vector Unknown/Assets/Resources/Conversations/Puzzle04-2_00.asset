    sentences:
    - These gaps are going to be a bit more difficult than last time.
    - Last time the goal was in the X or the Z direction.
    - This time the goals are in both the X AND Z directions.
    - You'll have to pay attention to each vector's X/Z values when using the scalars.
    - Adjusting the scalar will increase/decrease the resulting vector in both directions.
