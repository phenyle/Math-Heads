DONE:
Puzzle 3 Rework:
- Fixed the audio crash bug on the higher difficulties of puzzle 3
- All 3 difficulties are now operational for playing
- Each new difficulty has a new starting dialog
- Added new Database items and functionality for user tracking
-----CAVEAT:
	You may need to create a new account to save to the new database sheets
	I suspect it's due to old accounts not having these new sheets when they were created
	Looking into a fix, but this may just be a limitation of GoogleSheetsForUnity.
- Question portal is now brighter and has more pizzaz to make it more noticable
- New UI element showing how many moves the player has submited in getting to the goal and the time spent
- New user tracking includes the time spent on the puzzle, the number of moves used to solve it and the starting rotation
- in addition it also tracks each move as they make it.  That information is saved in a separate cell in a CSV format
HubWorld Changes:
- Moved the location of Puzzle3 building and portal closer, running across the empty island is boring
- Changed the scenery around Puzzle 4 portal
----- Puzzle 4's portal was just in the middle of nowhere and looked very boring and plain
----- The new surrounding shallow island sand bank better reflects the puzzle level of hopping island to island.
- Changed the look of broken ship hull
----- the broken ship hull now looks more noticablly different from the repaired version
----- broken ship now has grass growing out of it and vines
----- the color has also been changed to make the fixed version appear more vibrant
- When finishing a puzzle for the first time, the camera now moves to the ship in a pleasent little up/down arc
- The camera locations for looking at the repairs have been tweaked to better see what's going on.
- New assets added on the ship for solving difficulties of Puzzle3
- Finishing all 3 difficulties of Puzzle3 adds some sparkles around the treasure
- Finishing all 3 difficulties of Puzzle4 adds extra ship rigging and sails
Added new functionality to the LevelSelectUI:
- LevelSelectUI now shows the best completion time for completed levels
- Added support for Puzzle03 multilevels
Database Changes:
- New attempts/move data tracking
---- Both puzzle 3 and puzzle 4 now track what the player is doing as they solve for the answers
---- This data is saved in a cell in a CSV format
---- Each new line in the cell is a different attempt or move made
---- For puzzle3 the format follows: Number of Move, Time, span1X, span1Y, span1Z, span2X, span2Y, span2Z
---- Note for puzzle3, I'm not recording the 3rd vector point as it is assumed and always [0,0,0]
---- For puzzle4 the format follows: Number of Attempt, Time, scal1, vect1X, vect1Y, vect1Z, scal2, vect2X, vect2Y, vect2Z
Dialog Changes:
- Starting dialog for new players now briefly tells the player what happened, where the ship parts are and what the puzzles are
- Minor tweaks to misc dialogs to better fit the theme of the rebuilding the ship
- Changed puzzle3 "story" from being about saving civilians to being about getting back your ship gold.
- Added new dialog to puzzle3 level 1 to inform the player that they can rotate the camera



STILL NEED TO DO:
Puzzle2 UI overhaul
Bulletin/Progress Report Board
Create a grammar and format for how data is saved to the database for easier parsing



KNOWN BUGS:
Solving Puzzle03 without ever rotating the camera causes the camera to hang instead of returning to player
LevelSelectUI is ghosting scores from different levels on stage2
Puzzle4 causes problems on the extremely rare chance 2 answer cards have the same vector values (the game treats both cards as the same card)
Player selecting "Tutorial" from the title screen, then pressing "Hub" in the pause menu allows the player to circumvent logging in or joining a session (probably just going to hide that button in tutorial).
