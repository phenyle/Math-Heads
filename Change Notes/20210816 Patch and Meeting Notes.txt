DONE:
Updated Pause Menu UI

- Changed "Menu" button to quit to title
- Both buttons have a popup confirming their selection
- Added a new slider in settings to adjust the camera rotation speed
HubWorld Changes:
- Reduced the wait timer for shipRepair after completeing a level for the first time
- Removed Old "ship repair" assets
- Replaced the ground glow portals with standing portals (easier to see)
- Fixed the portal text overlaying everything
- Lowered the "bridge" between the islands to stop popping up
Added new functionality to the LevelSelectUI:
- LevelSelectUI now shows the best completion time for completed levels

Database Changes:
- Database now saves individual player settings (sound volume, mouse speed)
- Added new database entries for Puzzle 3
Puzzle03 Changes:
- Fixed Minimap of spans for better visibility
- Overhauled UI problems of instance vs prefab vs code changes (this was a nightmare)

---- Every time the stage is played the level may be rotated on Y in 90degrees
- Changed the position of the player so that they start facing the same direction as minimap
- Also player is not just an amorphous being, User has control of player again
- Split Puzzle03 into 3 separate levels of difficulty (but some bug is killing levels 2 and 3, fix later).
