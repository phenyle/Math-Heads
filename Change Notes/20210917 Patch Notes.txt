DONE:
New Account Changes:
-- New accounts now have a drop down list for selecting a school
-- Current listed schools are only ASU and CSU and Other
-- Selecting "Other" from the drop down enables a text field to manually enter school name
-- Added new error pop-ups to check if school selected/entered
-- Changed the font sizes on the drop down lists to make them easier to read

DataBase Changes:
-- Added new functionality to the GFSU to update specific tables
-- Exiting the puzzle now only updates that specific puzzle table on GoogleSheets
------This is to cut down on traffic and limit errors when saving player data
------When first logging in ONLY the "users" table is loaded
-- Created new metrics under the "User" table to track number of attempts for any puzzle & difficulty
-- Puzzle tables now save multiple attempts by the same user
------The new attempt is denoted by their attempt number and a modified version of their username+attemptNumber
------Players may retry any puzzle (sans puzzle1) multiple times and each attempt is saved independently (assuming they finish the puzzle)
-- Fixed some bugs with Puzzle04 puzzleIDs getting mixed up when saving to the database
-- Added functionality for saving player School information
-- Changed the GFSU listing for database tables (from a string[] to an enum)
------Should limit possible future errors with mispelling, scaling, etc.

Pause Menu:
-- Eliminated the option "Hub" from the pause menu when the player is in the Tutorial
------This was causing a bug where the player could play the full game without ever logging in



STILL NEED TO DO:
Puzzle2 overhaul
Bulletin/Progress Report Board
Create a grammar and format for how data is saved to the database for easier parsing



KNOWN BUGS:
Solving Puzzle03 without ever rotating the camera causes the camera to hang instead of returning to player
LevelSelectUI is ghosting scores from different levels on stage2
Puzzle4 causes problems on the extremely rare chance 2 answer cards have the same vector values (the game treats both cards as the same card)
